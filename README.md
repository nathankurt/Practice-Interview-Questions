# Practice-Interview-Questions

Just a bunch of practice interview questions that i'll work on.

## Amazon Coding Interview Question - Recursive Staircase Problem

This question asks you to find the number of ways you can go up a staircase given the size of the staircase and knowing you can only take one or two steps at a time like so.

The next part of the problem asks you how you would do it if you were given a set of steps that you could take. So for example given the set `X = {1,3,5}` that means you can only take 1 step, 3 steps, or 5 steps at a time. And then you have to figure out the number of ways to solve this problem.

## Amazon Coding Interview Question - K Closest Points to the Origin

Given a list of tuples like `points_tuple = [(-2,4), (0,-2), (-1,0), (2,5), (-2,-3), (3,2), (1,0)]` find the k closest points to origin. So in this case, if `k=2` then the k closest points would be `(-1,0)` and `(0,-2)`
